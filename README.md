## Features Created in the App

In this app, I developed the following features, each presented on separate tabs in the Gradio interface:

1. **Text Summarization**: A tool that condenses long pieces of text into concise summaries, highlighting the main points and key information.

2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: An NLP feature that identifies and classifies entities (such as names of people, organizations, locations, etc.) within the input text.

3. **Image Captioning**: A module that generates descriptive captions for uploaded images, providing a brief and relevant summary of the visual content.
